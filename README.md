# Week 01: Introduction

This repository contains all the resources from the first session of the NYU Data Science Bootcamp. In the first week, we covered the basics of Python and Git to help everyone get started.

**Instructor:** Sagar Patel

The recording of the session can be found [here](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/cPYtSdMKV1_U5FAxfdZhWH3kii2OzWjPdv2PqkuqwUMrM3WxysGTwRHzK-X3kpqN.KzaT3otOvPl1e7Jb)

## Practice tasks for Week 01 (Optional)

**NOTE:** These tasks are optional and only for your practice. They will not be graded but they can be shared with the instructor for feedback.

1. Clone the repository to the local machine.
2. Create a repository on your GitHub profile and name it `data-science-bootcamp`. The repository should have the name `<username>/data-science-bootcamp`.
    1. Clone that repository to the local machine as well.
3. From the current repository, move the folder `task-week1` to your repository. </br>*Hint: you can simply drag and drop or copy/paste the directory*
4. Identify yourself: Open the `Identify.txt` file and enter your name, netid, and your favorite book and author.
5. Add/move files:
    1. Create a new file named hello-world.txt and commit it to the repo.
    2. Create a new directory named `Hello` and move `hello-world.txt` into that directory.
    3. Finally commit the changes in the previous step.

Once you are done with this and would like the intsructor to review it, share the URL of your repository with the Instructor.
